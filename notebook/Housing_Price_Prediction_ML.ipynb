    "## 1. Big Picture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to build a model that predicts **median housing prices** for districts in California using census data.  \n",
    "Each district (block group) includes features such as population, median income, and housing-related statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should learn meaningful patterns from historical data and generalize well to new, unseen districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Framing the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building any model, it is essential to understand the **business objective**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model’s predictions will be used as an **input to another machine learning system**\n",
    "- That downstream system determines whether it is worth investing in a given district\n",
    "- Prediction accuracy directly impacts business revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, housing prices are estimated manually by experts using up-to-date information and complex domain-specific rules.  \n",
    "The goal of this project is to automate and improve this process using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Type and Learning Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning type:** Supervised learning  \n",
    "- **Task:** Regression  \n",
    "- **Regression structure:**\n",
    "  - Multiple regression (multiple input features)\n",
    "  - Univariate regression (a single target value)\n",
    "- **Training approach:** Batch learning  \n",
    "  - The dataset fits in memory  \n",
    "  - There is no need for frequent or real-time updates  \n",
    "\n",
    "This framing directly influences the choice of algorithms, evaluation metrics, and system design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "For this regression task, **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** is used as the evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE provides a clear measure of how large prediction errors typically are, while penalizing larger errors more strongly.  \n",
    "This makes it well-suited for housing price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions Check\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical assumption is that the **actual predicted prices** are required by the downstream system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If prices were later converted into categories (e.g., *cheap*, *medium*, *expensive*), the problem would instead need to be framed as a classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "After confirming with the downstream team that **exact price values are required**, the regression framing is validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "With the problem clearly framed, assumptions verified, and performance metrics defined, the project is ready to move forward into data acquisition, exploration, and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach ensures the solution is:\n",
    "- Technically sound  \n",
    "- Aligned with business goals  \n",
    "- Maintainable and extensible in production  \n"
